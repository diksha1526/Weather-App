    <h1>About The App</h1>
    <div class="app">
        <p>Weather prediction today is largely based on expert systems. This is undoubtedly, a greatsolution. But the intricacies involved in computing the network required to infer all the cases isastronomically vast. Hence, a Machine learning based solution is capable of using a statisticallytuned ML-agent that harnesses the capabilities of traversing every case there realistically could be to create a fine tuned system wherein projections would be rather accurate for a much lessdevelopmental cost and computational cost alike</p>
